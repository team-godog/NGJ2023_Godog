# Godog

**Godog** is a sled dog racing adventure created in 2 days for
[Nordic Game Jam 2023](https://nordicgamejam.com/), inspired by elements of the
Sámi culture.

Play as a sled dog sent to deliver healing herbs to a far off village.
Pick up the 3 herbs on the way down the slope and try not to crash!

**Controls:**

- A/D or Left/Right keys or Left Stick X axis for steering.
- W/S or Up/Down keys or Left Stick Y axis for acceleration/deceleration.
- R key or X button to reset the character upright if stuck (press multiple
  times to move back if really stuck).
- B key or B button is a surprise.

**Credits:** Andy, Angela, Aurora, Buster, Freke, Gabriel, Louise, Rémi.
